The theme embeds an inline Markdown image by default **as a float** in the containing block.

This page shows the layout options for embedded images. Their extended syntax is similar to the one for stand-alone images and is explained on the page for the [general image syntax](https://perplex.desider.at/doc/basic/image/syntax).

An embedded image is often the first element of a paragraph. By **default**, it’s resized to half the width of a paragraph and placed at the beginning on the left. This is also the normal size and the first example.

All the other following options are only available for images that are registered as a [resource](https://perplex.desider.at/doc/intro/workflow/resources) in the front-matter. Then, we can change the size and the position with parameters, add a caption or attribution, etc…

## At the beginning

### Normal size {#normal}

![](img-normal) Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographical life. One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

{.blind .blind-right}

One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen.

## Indented text blocks

Embedded images take a fixed percentage of the width of the containing block: 

1. ![](img-tiny) Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

   - ![](img-tiny?posh=right) Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

   - ![](img-tiny) Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

2. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.  ![](img-tiny?posv=middle&posh=right) Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.

### Full size {.clear}

Usually, we use a normal-sized stand-alone image to use the full width of the text. But they don’t fit inside indented text blocks. Then, we can also place embedded images with the full width of the containing block like this:

1. Far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts:
   ![](img-normal?size=full)

2. Far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts:
   ![](img-normal?size=full)

or this

1. Far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts:
   ![](img-normal?size=full)

2. Far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts:
   ![](img-normal?size=full)
{.col2}
