I’m engaged in web publishing. My focus lies on a consistent layout structure and optimal legibility on modern devices. I’m specialized in fluid-responsive design because it can integrate many achievements of classic typographic page design.

A baseline grid bears fruit when the layout proportions stay fixed as they do on a physical page. And the fluid-responsive web page templates for themes like this one contain a few layout versions where each one beyond mobile preserves fixed proportions between its breakpoints.

**C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets
: are my main field of expertise. Style sheets are a collection of mechanisms to add fonts and styling to a web document. They’re not a programming language and every rigorous system reducing their complexity for the sake of technical maintainability tends to diminish their capabilities.

    I don’t follow one CSS methodology on my projects and combine particular achievements of {=SMACSS}, {=BEM}, and {=OOCSS}. In a similar manner, I use {=SASS} and {=PostCSS} to optimize and simplify the style sheet generation.

Markdown
: is a very popular heuristic markup system to structure text files. Because Markdown has been derived from intuitive markup habits in early text forums and emails it's sometimes overly simplistic. I’m an expert in enriching and styling the resulting HTML.

Hugo
: I’ve been using this reliable engine since version {$0.18} to build fast static websites that require minimal maintenance. When Markdown attributes became available in version {$0.86} I started to dive deep into Markdown styling. I’ve been constantly following Hugo’s growing capabilities and have become a proficient template programmer.

Javascript
: I have some experience with vanilla Javascript, Typescript, and the Node universe. I like to enhance sites with dynamic capabilities when the result justifies loading additional libraries (preferably on demand).

I’m also a writer and speaker (in German) with a focus on the epistemology of the natural sciences, and a lecturer at the University of Applied Sciences{/}in Frankfurt.
