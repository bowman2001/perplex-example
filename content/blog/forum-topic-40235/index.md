A definition list inside a blockquote with a sub-list in one of its items is an interesting problem for Markdown layout.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->

The problem came up in the [Hugo-forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/list-as-a-definition-list-item/40235). At first, it was a little unclear, so I created two demos. The original question was about the resulting HTML code.{^\*}

{{< mnote star=1 >}}
I donâ€™t include the resulting code, you can inspect it as usual with your browser tool.
{{< /mnote >}}

## Bullet list inside of definition list

### Version 1

>     - The selling expenses: transport. brokerage. discounts.
>     - The general expenses: administration, rents, taxes. insurance etc.
> {.dl-loose}

Markdown is very sensitive to indentation when combining various formatting signs and [attributes](https://perplex.desider.at/doc/attribute). We need to align our code correctly. Then, the HTML code is the expected one. Which version fits the content in the best way is a matter of taste.
