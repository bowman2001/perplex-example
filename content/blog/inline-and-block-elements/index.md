HTML generated from CommonMark Markdown includes only the standard layout modes for HTML tags: **inline & block**.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

The distinction between those two in Markdown is relatively simple. Every block is surrounded by at least one blank line at the top and the bottom or is visually separated by other means. Everything written on the same or the directly following line is included in a block. List items are blocks themselves and other nested elements may also be blocks. But the innermost elements of blocks are usually inline.

We don’t need to think about layout modes most of the time and use them intuitively correct. One problematic element is the main reason to recall the distinction:  

Inline elements
: behave like characters and may be embedded in text. They are placed on the same line as long as there is any horizontal space left --- and then the line wraps and so on. They may contain other inline elements --- like **a piece of `code` in emphasis** for example. Inline elements usually shouldn’t include block elements{^*}, but they always need to be embedded in block elements.
{.dl-loose}

{{< mnote up=12 star=1 >}}
It’s common practice to place an anchor-tag `<a>` around block elements to generate a linked elements in HTML.
{{< /mnote >}}

Block elements
: always completely fill the available width and may include additional vertical space. Block elements may contain other block elements or inline elements. A common example for the latter is a paragraph block, which fills at least one line, but may include an arbitrary amount of inline elements and text.
{.dl-loose}

## Confusing image element

The CommonMark Markdown [image element](https://perplex.desider.at/doc/basic/image) is creating some confusion, because it’s an inline element. Because images appear visually as blocks, we falsely tend to infer they are HTML block elements. But a CommonMark image is always inline and embedded in an enclosing block. When its placed stand-alone on a separated line, its not only an image but enclosed in a paragraph block of its own.

To generate a stand-alone image resulting in semantically correct HTML, we need an alternative. Since version 0.108 Hugo distinguishes between Markdown images placed **inline** or separated as a **block**.
